Udacity's Self-Driving car Nanodegree projects and notebooks.

This repository contains project files and lecture notes for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program which I started working on on 27 October, 2016.

The Self-Driving Car Engineer is an online certification intended to prepare students to become self-driving car engineers. The program was developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA, Otto, DiDi, BMW, McLaren and NextEv.

# Program Outline:
## Term 1: Deep Learning and Computer Vision
####1. Deep Learning:

* deep-learning-notes-and-labs: Notes on Deep Learning, Tensorflow and Keras
* Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier (Deep Learning)
* Project 3: Behavioural Cloning (Deep Learning)
* Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network.
* Input data comprises steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse / joystick in the simulator.

### 2. Computer Vision:
* computer-vision-notes-and-labs: Notes on Computer Vision
* Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)
* Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines (Computer Vision)
* Project 5: Vehicle Detection (Computer Vision)

**Behavioral Cloning Project**
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report
